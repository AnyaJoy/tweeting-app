# Tweeting App Project

Micro-blogging web application. Home task from the first month of Front-end course. In this project I was practicing my vanila JavaScript and raw CSS/HTML skills, while using Firebase for back-end. Looking back at it now - that's when I fell in love with coding.

This project was a part of Front-end development course from ITC. They provided the design and technical plan! It was fun making it and made me consider moving forward with learning back-end as well!
